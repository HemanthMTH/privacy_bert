  This tool is designed to help you visualize the similarity between different
  websites. The websites are divided into two main categories: 'Smart Device
  Manufacturer Websites', which are websites of companies that produce smart
  devices like watches, speakers, etc., and 'Popular Websites', which include a
  variety of well-known websites from different sectors. Our heatmap shows how
  similar these websites are to each other based on various factors like design,
  content, and user engagement. We used 2020 version privacy policies in this
  case.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  To use this tool, simply choose your preferred category - either 'Smart Device
  Websites' or 'Popular Websites'. Once you've selected a category, the heatmap
  will dynamically update to display your selected websites. The colors in the
  heatmap represent how similar the websites are - warmer colors represent high
  similarity, while cooler colors indicate less similarity. By using the toggle
  button, you can easily switch between the two categories. This way, you can
  explore, compare, and understand the similarities between different websites
  in an engaging and user-friendly manner. Enjoy exploring!
